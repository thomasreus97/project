## (Stacked)bar
This visualisation shows a stacked barchart of all provinces available. These stacks consist of all (in the legend shown in the Pie chapter above) selected occupancies. This is updatable by year.

The purpose of this visualisation is to combine the purposes of the map and the piechart, with a personalisation twist by being able to select the occupancies you want.
